# AWS-EC2-Website
A project where I launched an AWS EC2 instance, configured security groups, installed Nginx, and deployed a static website accessible via a public IP.

Steps:
Launched an EC2 instance with Ubuntu Server AMI (t2.micro, default VPC/subnet).
Configured security groups to allow SSH (port 22) and HTTP (port 80).
Connected to the instance via SSH using a key pair.
Installed Nginx and created a simple index.html file.

Challenges Faced. 
SSH issues need to change premison in windows file  

Deployed the website and accessed it at http://13.57.33.94.
